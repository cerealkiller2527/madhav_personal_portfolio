EXPERIENCE 
Embedded Systems and Software Intern | Liger Mobility | Mumbai, India                       May 2024 – July 2024 
• 
Delivered a Flutter-based scooter testing app with Firebase, capturing 1.7M+ weekly data points from 20+ test riders, 
enabling real-time analytics and performance insights. 
• 
Integrated a Bluetooth module into the Liger Scooter for real-time data transmission, reducing errors by 90% with cyclic 
redundancy checks and compressing data by 60% using run-length encoding. 
• 
Designed an electrically assisted steering system using a PID-controlled motor with an encoder, reducing rider effort by 
90% and enhancing precise control for sharp turns. 
• 
Optimized scooter teleoperation via AWS IoT Core and a web dashboard, reducing steering latency from 500ms to 50ms. 
• 
Prototyped a Raspberry Pi-based Flask server with OpenOCD, cutting wireless software update times from 10s to 1s. 
Test Design Engineer | Ayurythm | Bangalore, India                   April 2022 – July 2022 
• 
Crafted a health sensor testing platform for 30 developers, enabling real-time algorithm testing and data collection, 
which improved performance for over 750,000 app users. 
• 
Constructed a compact PCB with sensors, microcontroller, and display using Altium Designer, and created a small 3D-
printed chassis—reducing costs by 40% compared to V1. 
• 
Programmed Arduino functions with Kalman Filter signal processing to enhance the accuracy of heart rate and oxygen 
sensor data, enabling developers to rapidly integrate these improvements into their algorithms.
